# Hi, I'm Sam.
I'm an incoming senior at the University of Minnesota. I am primarily interested and experienced in backend and API development, using languages/tools like C#, Go, Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQL, etc.

In my free time I enjoy skiing, hiking, KenKen puzzles and coding.

Below is a collection of my skills, work experience, personal projects, etc. A note I would like to accompany these with is that I pride myself on my ability to embrace change and pick up new skills. If my experiences don't quite align with what an opportunity is looking for, I am confident I can adapt to be a good fit.


## Projects
[GopherGuessr](https://github.com/Divyesh-Thirukonda/gopherguessr): A campus-wide location guessing game, built off 1000+ crowd-sourced photos and played more than 15,0000 times. This was a group project through UMN's Social Coding club, my role involved designing a user authentication and profiling system in PostgreSQL and JS, as well as reducing game latency through Apache Kafka and websocket protocol integration. Very much inspired by GeoGuessr.

[Pro Football Reference API](https://github.com/BREISAMU/pro-football-reference-api): An external web-scraping powered API servicing GET requests to 10,000+ Pro Football Reference data tables. Allows for free, easy access to the extensive data provided by Pro Football Reference. This API was documented, tested and managed API using Postman, and containerized using Docker.

[KenKen Solver with Heuristic Evaluation](https://github.com/BREISAMU/kenken-heuristic-evaluation): An agent that solves KenKen puzzle matrices by representing them as constraint satisfaction problems, optimized through custom heuristics that prune the agent's search space. Can solve 9x9 KenKen puzzles in less than 4 seconds.

<b>Note: I believe these 3 projects best represent my ability, and are the ones I am most proud of. My full portfolio can be found on my Github profile.</b>


## Work Experience
### Software Engineering Intern - DraftKings:
- Designed REST API endpoints to power user navigation across Pick6, each receiving 2 million requests a day.
- Used C#, ASP.NET, and Apache Kafka to build efficient backend systems that enable real-time data communication across services.
- Leveraged Docker, Kubernetes and Jenkins-based CI/CD pipelines to automate build, deployment, and scaling workflows.

### Teaching Assistant - University of Minnesota
- Taught C++ and OOP fundamentals to almost 200 students, leading daily labs and office hours.
- Enhanced my programming and collaboration skills by resolving studentsâ€™ bugs and roadblocks.
  
### Software Development Intern - WEC Energy Group
- Engineered a database management API that handles CRUD operations on internal logs, archives and metadata.
- Utilized VB.NET and Microsoft SQL Server to deliver solutions that improved operational efficiency across multiple teams.
- Refactored and streamlined over 30 legacy SQL procedures, reducing processing times by up to 40%.
